# Fraction Sum Calculator

This C program calculates the sum of two fractions entered by the user.

## How it Works

1. The program prompts the user to enter two fractions in the format "numerator/denominator".
2. It reads the input fractions and calculates the sum of their numerators and denominators.
3. Finally, it prints the sum of the fractions in the same format.

## Notes

- The program calculates the sum of fractions by finding a common denominator and adding their numerators.
- It assumes that the user enters valid fractions in the specified format.
- It demonstrates basic arithmetic operations and user input processing.
